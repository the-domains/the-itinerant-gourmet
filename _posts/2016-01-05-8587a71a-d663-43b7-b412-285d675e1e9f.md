What is this blog about? That's the question. I set this blogger up in 2008 when I had the inspiration to document food and cooking... And then promptly dropped the blogging idea... But I never deleted this account.

Since then I've had a lot more adventures and I've also ventured into photography. So now I'm determined to give this a go. I'll be posting about places to go eat in whatever county I happen to be in, our about places I've already been to and have documented. I'll be writing about them and posting them as I get to those wonderful places.

I'll also be reviewing the various airlines I've flown on and perhaps I'll have a useful travel tip or two. I ran into the idea of the grid and loved the idea, so I'm trying to revive my blog on this platform.
